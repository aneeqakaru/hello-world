Tutorial

Hello to all,

This is my first time using GitHub and as a part of tutorial I am excited to share about myself. I am a fan of hardware and design. I like to work in teams as I think it is more efficient to work and get creative end results in team. Temas help troubleshoot problems faster and easier. This is my first time working in a team for non academic reason, meaning by my choice, though in an academic setting.  Thats it for now! See you later!
